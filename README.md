Our project is on health care theme.
->Many a times, general public has many doubts regarding a particular disease, symptoms of a certain disease etc.                                 
->So, there’s a need of a platform where the     general doubts of common people are correctly answered by medical professionals.
->There’s also a need of platform where one can get data of number of covid-19 cases in different countries and also receive the latest news related to Covid-19

Solution:
->Our android application will take input of medical questions from general public.
->These questions will then be analyzed by medical professionals and correctly answered by them in most descriptive way possible.
->API & Retrofit will be used to showcase the data of Covid-19 in different countries and also receive the latest Covid-19 News.

Let’s talk about how we will be integrating the tech stack into our android mobile application…

->First, the user will be asked to register himself/herself as a medical professional or general user. (OTP verification using Firebase)
->If a medical professional has registered, then the mobile screen will show all the medical questions posted by general public around the world. (get data from Firebase)
->The medical professional can provide descriptive answers to these questions if they are relevant to their domain of work. (Uploading data to Firebase)
->If a general user has registered, then he can post his/her questions and also view the answers to different questions posted by other users.
->Either a medical professional or general user can view the data of number of covid-19 cases in different countries and receive the latest news related to Covid-19. (Use of API & Retrofit)
